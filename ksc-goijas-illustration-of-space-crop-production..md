This roadmap outlines a phased approach for establishing crop production to support human missions to Mars, integrating space agriculture as a core component for sustaining life during space exploration.

1. **ISS (International Space Station)**: The first phase involves crop research on the ISS, where crop production methods are developed to supplement astronauts' food systems. The ISS serves as a testing ground for validating these methods before they are used on longer missions, such as to Mars.
2. **Gateway/Early Lunar Missions**: Concurrent with or following the ISS phase, crop research continues with early missions in lunar orbit (presumably at the Lunar Gateway). Here, plants are grown in space conditions but closer to the Moon's surface, with perhaps varying gravity and radiation environments compared to the ISS.
3. **Early Lunar Outpost**: The next phase involves the establishment of an outpost on the Moon, where crop research continues. This setting provides supplemental nutrition with minimal infrastructure, and the methods are validated before proceeding to Mars missions.
4. **Lunar Settlement**: As an expansion of the lunar presence, a full settlement incorporates more advanced crop production, processing, food preparation, and life support system integration. This represents a more Earth-like setting for self-sufficiency and is likely a final testing stage before Mars missions.
5. **Mars Transit**: This phase focuses on developing a crop system for the journey to Mars. This system builds upon the research from the ISS, Lunar Gateway, and the lunar surface. The image depicts the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide within the system, indicating a closed-loop life support that recycles resources for sustainability.
6. **Early Mars Missions**: Once on Mars, the initial missions will focus on crop production to supplement the food system. This stage seems to indicate a direct continuation of the techniques developed during the transit phase, adapted to Mars' conditions.
7. **Mars Settlement**: The final phase of the roadmap involves establishing a sustainable human presence on Mars, with integrated systems for crop production, processing, and food preparation, along with full life support system integration. This stage aims to create a self-sustaining settlement with Earth-independent food production systems.

Throughout the roadmap, there is a strong emphasis on developing and validating technologies and methods in stages, ensuring each is robust enough for the next phase of the journey. This incremental approach helps mitigate risks associated with long-duration spaceflight and habitation on other celestial bodies.

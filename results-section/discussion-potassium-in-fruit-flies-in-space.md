# Discussion: Potassium in fruit flies in space

The Qlik X-Kingdom App’s design allows for efficient and seamless data analysis across multiple kingdoms. During the creation of this app, the changes to K+ ion pumps in response to spaceflight was a pattern found across kingdoms. Using the Qlik X-kingdom App, we are able to explore this further and analyse the response in a comprehensive manner.

The lactate shuttle is an essential component of neurological processes both in humans and other organisms. It functions as an energy signaling pathway found in intercellular spaces that fuels and regulates many process including the synaptic transmission of neurons (George)(fig A).&#x20;

Through the Empire’s cross-kingdom analysis, there are patterns suggesting the synaptic transmission of neurons are affected due to the dysregulation of the lactate shuttle in microgravity.When conducting a principal component analysis of M.muscus, the sensory perception of smell is affected (fig X).&#x20;

The role of Drosophila melanogaster informs us of the effects spaceflight and microgravity has on K+ pumps and subsequent cardiac function in both these individuals as well as Humans, plants, and animals. The data from OSD-347 showed more significant downregulation of genes in microgravity, however, there was still significant upregulation of genes in the Seizure group versus the wild type in both microgravity and ground though with a larger magnitude in microgravity. Figure 1 shows the significant difference of downregulated (sent side) and upregulated (right side) genes between Seizure group mutants of ground control versus Seizure channel mutants in Space flight.

This study indicates a general downregulation of genes related to cardiac function under microgravity (OSD-347). This can give us insight on the influence of microgravity on genes in other organisms with cardiac functions. This can be looped back to how K+ pumps are affected in microgravity as these ion channels create and maintain repolarization and changes of heart rate in humans (Bueno-Orovio). The study shown in figure 3 simulated microgravity and showed a similar effect on human cardiac progenitors cultures in microgravity versus standard gravity with more significant downregulated genes than upregulated genes (Wu).

Transmembrane signaling receptor activity was upregulated with a fold-change of 2.4 and an adjusted p-value of 1.21E-3 between seizure mutants in uG versus wildtype in uG in OSD-347. Compareing all D.melanogasdar studies, the transmembrane signaling receptor activity was upregulated between uG versus 1G.

\


These findings allow us to pursue further research to be able to make predictions of how spaceflight may effect essential cellular processes and come up with solutions as we continue to venture into space.
